        <h1>This is a f***ing website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's f***ing perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the f*** else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your sh** is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some f***ing Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a b***r because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, f***er. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Sh**'s lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your sh**ty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your sh**ty browsers</li>
            <li>The f***er's accessible to every a**hole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Sh**'s legible and gets your f***ing point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, f***er:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this sh**. It's a f***ing website. Why the f*** do you need to animate a f***ing trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of sh**? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your f***ing site, and some f***er jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that sh**. Not to mention blind people will never see that sh**, but they don't see any of your sh**ty sh**.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's f***ing lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your f***ing Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the f***ing background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a sh**ty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of sh**.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumba**. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever f***ing screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a f***ing Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It f***ing works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this sh**. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, f***er. It makes sense. It has f***ing hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your b***h-a** browser know what the f***'s in this f***ing site. That's semantics, f***er.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the f***ing screen. Your site has three bylines and a link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this f***er in IE6. I f***ing dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no f***ing idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are sh**ty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a f***ing message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's f***ing beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is f***ing satire, you f***</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your sh**ty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-b***h.</p>
